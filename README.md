# nbjob - Using Jupyter notebooks for machine learning research

See: http://nikitakitaev.com/nbjob

To install: `pip install git+git://github.com/nikitakit/nbjob.git@master`

See [the website](http://nikitakitaev.com/nbjob) for instructions regarding mandatory dependencies.

WARNING: This package is currently in a pre-alpha stage. I use it for my research, but can make no guarantees that it will work for others. It is developed using Python 3.4 and Jupyter 4.0.6 (older versions, in particular Python 2, will likely not work).

Comments and critiques welcome!
